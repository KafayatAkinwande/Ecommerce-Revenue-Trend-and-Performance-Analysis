### Business Context
This analysis examines revenue trends, growth rates, and performance drivers across product categories and geographic markets for the Olist Brazilian e-commerce marketplace. The goal is to identify opportunities for resource allocation, category investment, and geographic expansion.

### Key Findings
1. Revenue Growth: The marketplace achieved 114% year-over-year growth, with revenue increasing from R$2.99M (Jan-Aug 2017) to R$7.22M (Jan-Aug 2018). Current run rate based on Q3 2018 suggests annualized revenue of R$10.25M.

2. Volume-Driven Growth: Growth is primarily volume-driven, with order count surging from 21.9K to 52.7K orders (+140%), while AOV remained relatively stable (R$120 average), indicating successful customer acquisition strategy.

3. Geographic Concentration Risk: Revenue is heavily concentrated in São Paulo (38.3% of customer orders), with top 3 states accounting for 63% of revenue.
   However, emerging markets like Roraima show exceptional growth (+500% YoY).
   Healthy Category Diversification: Top 3 categories represent only 25.9% of revenue, indicating balanced portfolio with reduced concentration risk across 70+ product categories.

### Top Priority Recommendation
Invest in geographic expansion beyond SP/RJ/MG corridor while maintaining category diversification. Specifically, scale customer acquisition in high-growth emerging states (RR, AP, AM) and optimize logistics to support 140% order volume growth trajectory.

## ANALYSIS & FINDINGS

### A. Overall Revenue Performance
#### High-Level Metrics


![KPI](https://github.com/KafayatAkinwande/Ecommerce-Revenue-Trend-and-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/KPIs.png)

##### Insight:
The marketplace processed over 96K delivered orders across 74 unique products, demonstrating significant scale and product diversity. The average order value of R$119 suggests a mix of low-to-mid value purchases typical of mass-market e-commerce.

#### Revenue Growth Trajectory

##### Key Findings:

- Sustained Growth: Revenue shows consistent upward trajectory from Jan 2017 through Aug 2018
- Seasonal Patterns:
- Acceleration: Growth rate appears to accelerate in H2 2018, with recent months showing highest revenue

#### Year-over-Year Growth Analysis

##### Strategic Insight:
The 114% year-over-year revenue growth is exceptional for an established marketplace. More importantly, this growth is volume-driven (order count +140%) rather than price-driven (AOV -1%), indicating successful customer acquisition and retention strategies. The stable AOV suggests we're maintaining product mix and not chasing high-ticket items at the expense of accessibility.

##### Run Rate Projection:
Based on Q3 2018 performance (Jun-Aug), the annualized run rate is R$10.25M, suggesting potential full-year 2018 revenue of R$10-11M if momentum continues.

### B. Product Category Performance

#### Category Revenue Distribution
!![Top product categories](https://github.com/KafayatAkinwande/Ecommerce-Revenue-Trend-and-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Top%2010%20Categories.png)

##### Product Diversification:

Top 3 categories (Health & Beauty, Watches & Gifts, Bed Bath Table) represent 25.9% of total revenue

This distribution is quite unhealthy and concentrated for a typical e-commerce. 

##### Category Insights:

Health & Beauty (Leader): High order volume with moderate AOV suggests mass-market appeal
Watches & Gifts (High AOV): Lower volume but higher-value purchases; potential for targeted marketing
Bed Bath Table: Strong volume indicating household goods demand
Computers (High AOV = R$1,098): Premium category with only 30 products sold generating R$218K - opportunity for expansion

##### Volume vs. Value Analysis:

Volume leaders: Bed Bath Table (3,029 orders) drives sales through quantity
Value leaders: Computers (AOV R$1,098) and Watches command premium prices
Balanced performers: Health & Beauty combines solid volume (2,444) with above-average spend

### C. Geographic Performance Analysis

![Top 10 State](https://github.com/KafayatAkinwande/Ecommerce-Revenue-Trend-and-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Top%2010%20state.png)

#### State-Level Revenue Distribution

##### Geographic Concentration Risk:

- São Paulo dominates with 38.3% of revenue
- Top 3 states (SP, RJ, MG) account for 63.3% of total revenue
- Southeast region concentration creates logistics efficiency but market dependency risk

##### Regional Patterns:

High AOV states: High AOVs >R$150 are amonngst the lowest revenue generating state suggests, lower income demography concentration
Volume states: SP leads in order count, indicating established market penetration
Underserved regions: Northern and Central-West states show lower penetration despite population size

#### State Growth Rate Analysis
![State Growth Rate](https://github.com/KafayatAkinwande/Ecommerce-Revenue-Trend-and-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20State%20Growth.png))

##### Emerging Market Opportunity:

- Roraima (RR) shows exceptional 299% growth (R$1.4K → R$5.6K), though from small base
- Northern states (RR, AP, AM) display double digit growth rates, indicating early-stage market penetration
- Established markets (SP, and MG) show >15% growth, demonstrating continued strong performance

##### Expansion Recommendation:
While absolute revenue in emerging states is small, the explosive growth rates suggest:

- Untapped market potential in Northern/Central-West regions
- Logistics improvements have enabled reach to previously underserved areas
- Opportunity to capture market share before competitors scale

##### Risk Mitigation:
The 63% concentration in top 3 states creates dependency risk. Economic downturn or regional disruption in Southeast could significantly impact revenue. Diversification into high-growth emerging markets would balance portfolio.

87.5% (7 out of 8) of states experiencing negative growth rates are located in the North and NorthEast Region. Though the value or percentage decrease is not signitficant. It can be looked into further the reason for the concentration in that region.

##  STRATEGIC INSIGHTS 
Olist Ecommerce is a High-Growth Marketplace with Strong Fundamentals. The market is experiencing exceptional growth (114% YoY) driven by successful customer acquisition and volume expansion. With 70+ product categories generating revenue, the platform demonstrates healthy diversification that reduces concentration risk. However, geographic concentration in the Southeast region (63% of revenue) and product concentration presents both an operational advantage and a strategic vulnerability.

### Critical Success Factors
#### What's Working Well:

- Exceptional Volume Growth (+140% orders): Customer acquisition strategy is highly effective
- Balanced Category Portfolio (Top 3 = 26%): Diversification protects against category-specific shocks
- Stable Unit Economics (AOV R$119): Pricing strategy maintains value without sacrificing growth
- Accelerating Momentum (Q3 run rate R$10.25M): Recent performance suggests continued expansion

#### Areas of Concern:

- Geographic Over-Concentration (63% in 3 states): Creates regional dependency risk
- Slight AOV Decline (-1%): Warrants monitoring to ensure margin preservation
-  Data Limitations: Analysis limited to Aug 2018; recent trends unknown
-  Producr over concentration

#### Key Surprises

- RR's(Roraima) 299% Growth: Small state showing explosive growth from R$1.4K to R$5.6K - early indicator of Northern region opportunity
- Computers Category Efficiency: Only 30 products sold generated R$218K (AOV R$1,098) - demonstrates high-value, low-volume opportunity
  
## BUSINESS RECOMMENDATION

### 1. Launch Northern Region Pilot Campaign:
The marketing team should allocate 15% of Q4 marketing budget to targeted campaigns in RR, AP, AM states. These states show potential growth from small bases and created early mover advantage. The expected Impact of this is to capture 5-10% revenue diversification from Southeast in 6 months.

### 2. Optimize Computers Category Supply:
Recruit 10-15 new sellers in Computer Accessories (current: 30 SKUs generating R$218K). As this is the highest AOV category (R$1,098) with limited inventory depth
This could result in an expected incremental revenue in 6 months.

### 3. Geographic Risk Mitigation Program
Reduce Top 3 state concentration from 63% to <55% through the following tactics:

- Launch state-specific promotional campaigns in RS, PR, SC (established but underweighted)
- Partner with regional logistics providers to improve delivery times in Central-West
- Create localized marketing content for Northern/Northeast regions

This can further be achieved by reallocating 20% of SP-focused spend to diversification initiatives, resulting in revenue shift to emerging regions
Expected Impact: 8-10% revenue shift to emerging regions

### 4. Category Portfolio Optimization
Maintain healthy 25-30% concentration in Top 3 categories while scaling total revenue through the following tactics:

- Quarterly category performance reviews
- Proactive seller recruitment in underrepresented categories
- Category-specific marketing budget allocation based on growth potential

This would increase sustained diversification as marketplace scales to R$20M+
