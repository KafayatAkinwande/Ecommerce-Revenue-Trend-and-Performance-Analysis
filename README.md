# Ecommerce Revenue Trend and Performance Analysis

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Business Context
This analysis examines revenue trends, growth rates, and performance drivers across product categories and geographic markets for the Olist Brazilian e-commerce marketplace. The goal is to identify opportunities for resource allocation, category investment, and geographic expansion.

#### Key Findings
1. Revenue Growth: The marketplace achieved 114% year-over-year growth, with revenue increasing from R$2.99M (Jan-Aug 2017) to R$7.22M (Jan-Aug 2018). Current run rate based on Q3 2018 suggests annualized revenue of R$10.25M.

2. Volume-Driven Growth: Growth is primarily volume-driven, with order count surging from 21.9K to 52.7K orders (+140%), while AOV remained relatively stable (R$120 average), indicating successful customer acquisition strategy.

3. Geographic Concentration Risk: Revenue is heavily concentrated in São Paulo (38.3% of customer orders), with top 3 states accounting for 63% of revenue.
   However, emerging markets like Roraima show exceptional growth (+500% YoY).
   Healthy Category Diversification: Top 3 categories represent only 25.9% of revenue, indicating balanced portfolio with reduced concentration risk across 70+ product categories.

### Top Priority Recommendation
Invest in geographic expansion beyond SP/RJ/MG corridor while maintaining category diversification. Specifically, scale customer acquisition in high-growth emerging states (RR, AP, AM) and optimize logistics to support 140% order volume growth trajectory.
