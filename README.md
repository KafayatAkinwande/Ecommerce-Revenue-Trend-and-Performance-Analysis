# Ecommerce Revenue Trend and Performance Analysis

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Business Context
This analysis examines revenue trends, growth rates, and performance drivers across product categories and geographic markets for the Olist Brazilian e-commerce marketplace. The goal is to identify opportunities for resource allocation, category investment, and geographic expansion.

#### Key Findings
1. Revenue Growth: The marketplace achieved 114% year-over-year growth, with revenue increasing from R$2.99M (Jan-Aug 2017) to R$7.22M (Jan-Aug 2018). Current run rate based on Q3 2018 suggests annualized revenue of R$10.25M.

2. Volume-Driven Growth: Growth is primarily volume-driven, with order count surging from 21.9K to 52.7K orders (+140%), while AOV remained relatively stable (R$120 average), indicating successful customer acquisition strategy.

3. Geographic Concentration Risk: Revenue is heavily concentrated in São Paulo (38.3% of customer orders), with top 3 states accounting for 63% of revenue.
   However, emerging markets like Roraima show exceptional growth (+500% YoY).
   Healthy Category Diversification: Top 3 categories represent only 25.9% of revenue, indicating balanced portfolio with reduced concentration risk across 70+ product categories.

### Top Priority Recommendation
Invest in geographic expansion beyond SP/RJ/MG corridor while maintaining category diversification. Specifically, scale customer acquisition in high-growth emerging states (RR, AP, AM) and optimize logistics to support 140% order volume growth trajectory.

## ANALYSIS & FINDINGS

#### High-Level Metrics

##### Insight:

#### Revenue Growth Trajectory

##### Key Findings:

- Sustained Growth: Revenue shows consistent upward trajectory from Jan 2017 through Aug 2018
- Seasonal Patterns:
- Acceleration: Growth rate appears to accelerate in H2 2018, with recent months showing highest revenue

#### Year-over-Year Growth Analysis

##### Strategic Insight:
The 114% year-over-year revenue growth is exceptional for an established marketplace. More importantly, this growth is volume-driven (order count +140%) rather than price-driven (AOV -1%), indicating successful customer acquisition and retention strategies. The stable AOV suggests we're maintaining product mix and not chasing high-ticket items at the expense of accessibility.

##### Run Rate Projection:
Based on Q3 2018 performance (Jun-Aug), the annualized run rate is R$10.25M, suggesting potential full-year 2018 revenue of R$10-11M if momentum continues.

### B. Product Category Performance

#### Category Revenue Distribution
!![Top product categories](https://github.com/KafayatAkinwande/Ecommerce-Revenue-Trend-and-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Top%2010%20Categories.png)

##### Product Diversification:

Top 3 categories (Health & Beauty, Watches & Gifts, Bed Bath Table) represent 25.9% of total revenue

This distribution is quite unhealthy and concentrated for a typical e-commerce. 

##### Category Insights:

Health & Beauty (Leader): High order volume with moderate AOV suggests mass-market appeal
Watches & Gifts (High AOV): Lower volume but higher-value purchases; potential for targeted marketing
Bed Bath Table: Strong volume indicating household goods demand
Computers (High AOV = R$1,098): Premium category with only 30 products sold generating R$218K - opportunity for expansion

##### Volume vs. Value Analysis:

Volume leaders: Bed Bath Table (3,029 orders) drives sales through quantity
Value leaders: Computers (AOV R$1,098) and Watches command premium prices
Balanced performers: Health & Beauty combines solid volume (2,444) with above-average spend

### C. Geographic Performance Analysis

#### State-Level Revenue Distribution

##### Geographic Concentration Risk:

São Paulo dominates with 38.3% of revenue
Top 3 states (SP, RJ, MG) account for 63.3% of total revenue
Southeast region concentration creates logistics efficiency but market dependency risk

##### Regional Patterns:

High AOV states: [Identify states with AOV >R$150 - suggests wealthier demographics or different product mix]
Volume states: SP leads in order count, indicating established market penetration
Underserved regions: Northern and Central-West states show lower penetration despite population size
