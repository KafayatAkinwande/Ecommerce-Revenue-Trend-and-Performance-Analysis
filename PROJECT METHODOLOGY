METHODOLOGY , DATA QUALITY & ASSUMPTIONS

Tools & Approach

Database: PostgreSQL for data extraction and analysis
Visualization: Power BI for interactive dashboard
Framework: SCAN methodology (Stakeholder goals, Columns, Aggregates, Notable segments)

Data Quality Notes
Inclusions:
- Orders with order_status = 'delivered' only
- Date range: January 2017 - August 2018 (full operational data)

❌ Exclusions:

- September-December 2016 (incomplete and imcomplete data maybe due to platform beta/soft launch phase)
- Cancelled and pending orders
- Orders with missing delivery dates

⚠️ Known Limitations:

1.85% of products lack category classification (labeled as 'unknown_category')
Data ends August 2018 (projections beyond this use run rate methodology)
Two products have no English trandlations

Key Assumptions

- Growth rates use apples-to-apples comparison (Jan-Aug 2017 vs Jan-Aug 2018)
- Run rate calculated from most recent 3 months (Jun-Aug 2018) annualized
- Currency values not adjusted for inflation (nominal R$)
